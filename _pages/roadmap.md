# Assignments
Assignments are announced in the **#mlcourse_ai_news** channel in [ODS Slack team](https://opendatascience.slack.com/) (pinned items). Also, links to fresh assignments are provided in the Readme file of the [course repository](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai) and on [mlcourse.ai/assignments](assignments). Apart from that, you can practice with demo [assignments](assignments), don't confuse them with "real" ones. Rough plan for fall 2019 assignments is the following:
 - A1. Pandas and data analysis
 - A2. 2 parts. Decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting. Beating a baseline in a competition (gradient boosting)
 - A3. 2 parts: Beating baselines in a competition (linear models). Logistic regression vs. Random Forest
 - A4. Time series analysis with Python
 
If stuck with assignments, check course [video lectures](lectures).

# Quizzes & Live sessions
Quizzes are intended to check your understanding of theory behind the applied approaches. Will be announced in the **#mlcourse_ai_news** channel as well. 

 - Q1. Decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting. From Sept 9 to Sept 27 
 - Q2. Linear models. From Oct 7 to Oct 25
 - Q3. Time  series, unsupervised learning. From Oct 28 to Nov 15
 
Deadline for each quiz is Friday, each quiz is followed by a live session on a Saturday morning. During live session we go through quiz questions and have agile debates.  

# Kaggle Inclass Competition "Alice"

In this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2), you'll be solving the task of user identification tracking his/her sequence of visited websites. Lets call it "Alice", because we'll be classifying whether a person is some Alice or somebody else. The competition is held together with Yandex and MIPT specialization (so please don't spoil the competition by sharing high-performing Kaggle Notebooks).

Rules:
- Deadline is October 27, 2019
- You can make maximum 5 submissions a day, and the competition is individual (that is, 1 person per team, team mergers are not allowed)
- In case you want to get credits, you need to rename your [team](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2/team) (of 1 person) in full accordance with your name in course [rating](https://bit.ly/2mbv5FF)
- if you overfitted and dropped several paces down on private LB, no offense, it's life, only private LB is used to calculate credits for top-10 (this is not the case for A3 - there you have to beat baselines w.r.t. Public LB, it’s easier)
- Up to October 30, those who managed to beat all benchmarks should upload their reproducible solutions in the .py format (python script) [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/GG5MUBGgJZrYHjCoZl9c)

## Rules
Necessary conditions to get credits:
   - You need to stick to [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2/rules)
   - Beat all Yorko's baselines on private LB
   - A reproducible solution should be submitted in a specified period
   - Team name exactly corresponding to some entry in the course rating 
   
## Credits
   - 1 place – 40 credits
   - 2 place – 30 credits
   - 3 place – 25 credits
   - 4-10 place – 20 credits
   
# Kaggle Inclass Competition "DotA 2 winner prediction"
In this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlcourse-dota2-win-prediction) you are going to utilize all knowledge and skills acquired during the course session. Discussions are held on Kaggle itself, here is an [introductory thread](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlcourse-dota2-win-prediction/discussion/109081).

## Rules
 - Deadline for submissions: **2019 November 18, 20:59 GMT**
 - Teams up to 4 people are allowed. You need to name your team like **"mlcourse\_ai\_fall2019\_team\_\<id1\>\_...\<id4\>"**, where ids are positions of team members in the course [rating](https://bit.ly/2mbv5FF) as of November 18th 
 - Till November 20, you have time to upload your team's reproducible solution [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/9CkAPWd4iX8oWFpS8n4S)
 - The results of the competition and the final course rating will be published on 2019 November 22.
 
## Credits
 Grading is as close as possible to "real" Kaggle competitions, but we don't penalize for team size, each team member gets the specified amount of credits
   - 1 place – 60 credits
   - 2 place – 50 credits
   - 3 place – 40 credits
   - 4-10 place – 30 credits
