# Assignments
Assignments are announced in the **#mlcourse_ai_news** channel in [ODS Slack team](https://opendatascience.slack.com/) (pinned items). Also, links to fresh assignments are provided in the Readme file of the [course repository](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai) and on [mlcourse.ai/assignments](assignments). Deadlines are typically on Sundays, 20:59 CET. Apart from that, you can practice with demo [assignments](assignments), don't confuse them with "real" ones. Rough plan for fall 2019 assignments is the following:
 - A1. Pandas and data analysis
 - A2. Decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting. Beating a baseline in a competition (gradient boosting)
 - A3. Beating baselines in a competition (linear models)
 - A4. Beating baselines in one more competition using Vowpal Wabbit
 - A5. Time series analysis with Python
 
If stuck with assignments, check course [video lectures](lectures).

# Quizzes & Live sessions
Quizzes are intended to check your understanding of theory behind the applied approaches. Will be announced in the **#mlcourse_ai_news** channel as well. 

 - Q1. Decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting. From Sept 9 to Sept 27 
 - Q2. Linear models. From Oct 7 to Oct 25
 - Q3. Time  series, unsupervised learning. From Oct 28 to Nov 15
 
Deadline for each quiz is Friday, each quiz is followed by a live session on a Saturday morning. During live session we go through quiz questions and have agile debates.
