# Assignments
Assignments are announced in the **#mlcourse_ai_news** channel in [ODS Slack team](https://opendatascience.slack.com/) (pinned items). Also, links to fresh assignments are provided in the Readme file of the [course repository](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai) and on [mlcourse.ai/assignments](assignments). Deadlines are typically on Sundays, 20:59 CET. Apart from that, you can practice with demo [assignments](assignments), don't confuse them with "real" ones. Rough plan for fall 2019 assignments is the following:
 - A1. Pandas and data analysis
 - A2. Decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting. Beating baseline in the “flight delays” competition
 - A3. Beating baselines in the Alice competition
 - A4. Beating baselines in one more competition using Vowpal Wabbit
 - A5. Time series analysis with Python
 
If stuck with assignments, check course [video lectures](lectures).

# Kaggle Inclass Competition "Alice"

In the [1st competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) you'll be solving a task of user identification using tracking of his/her visited websites. Let’s call this competition "Alice", because we'll be classifying whether a person is Alice (let's say, intruder) or somebody else (innocent users). The competition is held in cooperation with Yandex and MIPT specialization "Machine Learning and Data Analysis" (in Russian).

## Rules:

- Deadline for submissions: 2019 March 10th
- You can make maximum 5 submissions a day, and the competition is individual (that is, 1 person per team, team merges are not allowed)
- In case you want to get credits, you need to rename your team (of 1 person) in full accordance with your name in the course [rating](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LAy1eK8vIONzIWgcCEaVmhKPSj579zK5lrECf_tQT60)
- if you overfitted and plunged several positions down on the private LB - no offense, it's life. Only private LB is used to calculate final credits (that's not true for baselines in A2, check instructions therein)
- Till March 17th, those who managed to beat all benchmarks must upload their reproducible solutions in the .py format (python script) [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/i4HUVdwQWTSUtfUEJndV), more details are provided in [this post](https://opendatascience.slack.com/archives/C39147V60/p1551744009070400) (dated March 5th) in the #mlcourse_ai_news channel
- The results of the competition and the final course rating will be published on 2019 April 26th.

## Scoring rules for competitions (Alice & Medium):

### Necessary conditions:
   - Beat all Yorko's baselines on the private LB

### Credits: 
   - 1 place – 40 credits

## Grading tutorials
Grading is solely done by other participants upvoting Kernels on Kaggle in the mlcourse.ai [Kaggle Dataset](https://inclass.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/mlcourse/kernels). Best tutorials will get up to 40 credits. The exact grading formula is to be provided later. Voting is finalised on 2019 April 26th.
