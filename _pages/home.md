[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open Machine Learning course by [OpenDataScience (ods.ai)](https://ods.ai/), lead by [Yury Kashnitsky (yorko)](https://yorko.github.io/). Having both a Ph.D. degree in applied math and a Kaggle Competitions Master tier, Yury aimed at designing a ML course with a perfect balance between theory and practice. Thus, you go through math formulae in lectures, and practice with Kaggle Inclass competitions. Currently, the course is in a **self-paced mode**. Check out a thorough [Roadmap](roadmap) guiding you through the self-paced mlcourse.ai.
