**How do I register for the course?**

There's no formal registration for the course. Everybody is by default accepted and will be found in the course rating as long as submits web-forms for assignments. But it's easier to keep track of everything if you're in ODS Slack, so you'd better fill in the introductory form mentioned in the main page.

**What is the expected workload in hours per week?**

As usual for a MOOC, the median is around 4-6 hours per week. However, Kaggle and individual projects are addictive and time-consuming so you can end up spending >20 h/week. Those who spent that much time on mlcourse.ai never regretted I guess. 

**How do I join Slack community?**

If you register for the course, you'll be invited prior to the course start. Check carefully your email address.

**I've filled in the form, still no invitations and confirmations**

Please wait till the start of the new session. 

**Am I not accepted?**

No, you are by default accepted. The course is open for everyone. 

**What do I do if I don't get access to Slack when the course has already started?**

 - Check spam folder
 - Anyway, try to log in to [https://opendatascience.slack.com](https://opendatascience.slack.com)
 - Lastly, try to fill in the intro form (mentioned on the [main page](https://mlcourse.ai/)) with a different e-mail address

**How do I prepare for the course?**

You need basic Python skills and math knowledge. There are also some software requirements. Check out [prerequisites](prerequisites).

**How do I work with course materials?**

You can do it just in a browser with [this Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/mlcourse). However, if you are fine with git & GitHub, then forking the [course repo](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai) is a preferred way. 

**Will there be new video lectures?**

Check out [mlcourse.ai/lectures](lectures), only few will be added.

**Can I join the course on the go?**

Yes, at any point till the ongoing session is over. 

**Will I get a certificate when I've finished the course?**

No. Real knowledge and skills are much more important. 

**Can I at least prove that I've done a good job?**

Yes, if you finish in top-100 according to the final course rating. Your name will be [immortalized](rating).
